# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find my open source projects [here](https://github.com/leplusorg?tab=repositories).

All these projects are tested, released using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and
all the commits and published artifacts are digitally signed:
- GitHub Web UI and GitHub Desktop using [GitHub's verified signature](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits)
- Maven Central using public key [4C155617](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x6B1B9BE54C155617)
